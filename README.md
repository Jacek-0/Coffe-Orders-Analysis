# Coffe-Orders-Analysis
My first data analysis project: an interactive dashboard built in Excel, analyzing coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022. The dashboard includes insights into sales trends, customer segmentation, and preferences for coffee roast types and sizes. The data is fictional, focusing on showcasing analysis and visualization skills.
